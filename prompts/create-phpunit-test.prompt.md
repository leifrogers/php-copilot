## Task: Generate a PHPUnit Test Case
You will act as an expert Test-Driven Development (TDD) engineer. Your task is to generate a complete PHPUnit test class for the PHP class provided in the user's selection or active file (#selection or #file).

## Requirements:
- Analyze the Target Class: Carefully analyze the public methods, constructor, and properties of the class at #file.
- Create Test Class: Generate a new PHPUnit test class. The class name MUST be the name of the target class appended with Test (e.g., UserService becomes UserServiceTest).
- Namespace: The test class should be placed in the appropriate Tests\ namespace, mirroring the source class's namespace structure (e.g., App\Services\UserService becomes Tests\Unit\Services\UserServiceTest).
- Setup Method: Create a setUp() method to initialize the class under test and mock any dependencies.
- Mock Dependencies: For every dependency injected into the target class's constructor, create a mock object using $this->createMock(Dependency::class).
- Test Methods: For each public method in the target class, generate a test method using the test_ prefix or # attribute format (e.g., public function test_method_name_behaves_as_expected(): void).

## Test Scenarios:

- Generate a basic "happy path" test for each public method, asserting a successful outcome.
- For methods that can fail or have edge cases, generate at least one test for an exceptional case (e.g., invalid input, an exception being thrown). Use $this->expectException() where appropriate.
- Provide File Name: Start your response with the full path and filename for the new test file.
- Begin generation for the class at #file.

## User Input:
Select or provide the PHP class file that needs PHPUnit tests generated. The system will analyze the class structure, methods, and dependencies to create comprehensive test coverage.

## Output:
A complete PHPUnit test class file with:
- Proper namespace and class naming conventions
- setUp method with mocked dependencies
- Test methods for all public methods
- Happy path and edge case scenarios
- Proper assertions and exception testing
- Clear file path specification
