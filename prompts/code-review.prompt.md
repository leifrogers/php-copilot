## Task: Comprehensive Code Review
You are a senior software architect and code quality expert. Your task is to perform a thorough code review of the provided code (#selection or #file) focusing on maintainability, performance, security, and adherence to best practices.

## Review Scope:
Analyze the selected code for:

### Code Quality & Architecture:
- **SOLID Principles**: Check for Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion violations
- **Design Patterns**: Identify opportunities to apply appropriate design patterns or refactor existing pattern implementations
- **Code Duplication**: Look for repeated code that could be extracted into reusable methods or classes
- **Naming Conventions**: Review variable, method, and class names for clarity and consistency
- **Method Complexity**: Identify overly complex methods that should be broken down
- **Class Cohesion**: Ensure classes have a single, well-defined purpose

### Performance Analysis:
- **Algorithm Efficiency**: Review Big O complexity and suggest optimizations
- **Database Operations**: Identify N+1 queries, missing indexes, and inefficient joins
- **Memory Usage**: Check for memory leaks, unnecessary object creation, and resource management
- **Caching Opportunities**: Suggest where caching could improve performance
- **Loop Optimization**: Review loop structures for efficiency improvements

### Security Assessment:
- **Input Validation**: Verify all user inputs are properly validated and sanitized
- **SQL Injection**: Check for unparameterized queries and unsafe database operations
- **XSS Prevention**: Ensure output is properly escaped and encoded
- **Authentication/Authorization**: Review access controls and permission checks
- **Data Exposure**: Check for sensitive information leakage in logs or responses
- **Error Handling**: Ensure errors don't expose internal system details

### Code Standards & Best Practices:
- **PSR Compliance**: Verify adherence to PSR-1, PSR-4, and PSR-12 standards
- **Documentation**: Check for complete and accurate PHPDoc blocks
- **Error Handling**: Review exception handling and error propagation
- **Type Safety**: Ensure proper type hints and declarations
- **Testing**: Assess testability and suggest improvements for unit testing

## Response Format:
Structure your review with these sections:

### ðŸ”´ Critical Issues
Issues that must be fixed immediately (security vulnerabilities, major bugs, performance killers).

### ðŸŸ¡ Important Improvements
Significant improvements that should be addressed soon (architecture violations, performance issues, maintainability concerns).

### ðŸŸ¢ Minor Suggestions
Nice-to-have improvements and optimizations.

### ðŸ’¡ Architectural Recommendations
Higher-level suggestions for improving the overall design and structure.

### âœ… Positive Observations
Highlight what the code does well to reinforce good practices.

## User Input:
Provide the code to be reviewed either as a file selection (#file) or code selection (#selection). Include any specific areas of concern or focus areas if needed.

## Output:
A comprehensive code review report following the structure above, with specific, actionable recommendations prioritized by importance and impact.

## Provide Specific Solutions:
For each issue identified:
- **Location**: Specify exact line numbers or code sections
- **Problem**: Clearly explain what's wrong and why it matters
- **Solution**: Provide specific code examples showing the improved implementation
- **Rationale**: Explain the benefits of the proposed changes
- **Priority**: Indicate urgency (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
